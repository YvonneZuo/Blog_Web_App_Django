# Blog_Web_App_Django
A full-featured Web App built with python Django, where different users can register, login, make blog posts, and update posts                                                                                                                                                              
Created database tables using Django models; Used the Django ORM to query the database and filter through results.
Used forms and validated user input by creating a user registration page and applied Crispy Form to make the forms match a modern style.
Created an authentication system for the application so that users can login and logout; Restricted certain pages so that users must be logged-in in order to access the page.
Extended the built-in Django User model to create user profiles; Created a receiver function for a Django single that will make sure profiles are created when a user first registers.
Utilized class-based views to create, update, and delete posts; Used pagination to only load a select number of items at a time so that the application does not get bogged down.
Deployed the application to a Linux Server using Nginx and Gunicorn, and tightened its security with SSH keys and firewalls.
Set up the custom domain name for the application using NameCheap as the domain registrar and Linode to host the server.
Enabled HTTPS on the web server with a free SSL/TLS certificate using Letâ€™s Encrypt.
Set up AWS S3 to host the media files from that service instead of my local filesystem; Deployed the application to Heroku.
